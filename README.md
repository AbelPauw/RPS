This is a game of rock paper scissors.

When you start you get a option between playing against a computer or you can play against eachother.

If you play against a computer you get a choice between rock paper or scissors.
Rock < paper < scissors < rock. then the computer picks, depending on what you pick it could be a win lose or a tie.

If you play against eachother it works the same, but first player 1 picks and then player 2.
